                I like for you to be still, It is as though you are absent. 
                <br> 
                And you hear me from far away. And my voice does not touch you. 
                <br> 
                It seems as though your eyes had flown away. 
                <br> 
                And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth. 
                <br> 
                As all things are filled with my soul.
                <br> 
                You emerge from the things.
                <br> 
                Filled with my soul. You are like my soul. <a href="#" class="dead-link" >A butterfly of dream.</a>; 
                <br> 
                And you are like the word: Melancholy.
                <br>  
                 I like for you to be still.
                 <br> 
                And you seem far away. 
                <br> 
                It sounds as though you are lamenting. 
                <br> 
                 <a href="#" class="dead-link" >A butterfly cooing like a dove.</a>; 
                 <br> 
                 And you hear me from far away. And my voice does not reach you. 
                 <br> 
                That is bright as a lamp. <a href="#" class="dead-link" >And let me talk to you with your silence.</a>
                <br> 
                Simple, as a ring. 
                <br> 
                You are like the night. 
                <br> 
                With its stillness and constellations. 
                <br> 
                Your silence is that of a <span id="ghost" >star</span>. 
                <br> 
                As remote and candid
                <br> 
                I like for you to be still. 
                <br> 
                It is as though you are absent.
                <br> 
                 Distant and full of sorrow. 
                 <br> 
                 So you would've <span id="ghost" >die</span>.One word then, One smile is enough. 
                 <br> 
                 And I'm <span id="orange" >happy</span>. Happy that it's not true
